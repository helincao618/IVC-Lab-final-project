Image Quality Improvement Based on GAN
1. In the jupyter notebook or in the VS Code Run the ARGAN TRAIN FINAL.ipynp, and save the generate network netG3 and netD3
2. load the  network netD3 and Run the ARGAN TEST FINAL.ipynp, generate the final results(PSNR)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 and train repeatedly to change the epoch in ARGAN TRAIN FINAL.ipynp. Repeat the test in ARGAN TEST FINAL until the optimal PSNR is selected.
